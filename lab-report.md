# Lab Report: Reflections on Git Basics & Conflict Resolution

In this file I have the screenshots showing the conflict and the conflict markers that was created and resolved too, the successful push, the git commits, git merges, the several branches that were created.

I didn't find so much of the concepts confusing, and the assessment was very engaging and I also found out how impactful git is in DevOps with version control and all, I truly understood what version control was when creating different branches and merging them with the various command like git pull, git merge, etc.

Below is the link to the screenshots of my progress

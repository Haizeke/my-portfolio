#My DevOps Portfolio

I am Oni Obaloluwa, a Junior DevOps Engineer with a passion for automation, pivoting from a frontend development background. I don't just automate; I secure. From managing Linux user permissions with the Principle of Least Privilege to architecting Git workflows that ensure clean, revertible history, I focus on building resilient systems that teams can trust.
